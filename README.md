# 🚀 Find Me Recipes

Welcome to **Find Me Recipes**! This is something I developed at a relaxed pace to showcase how I approach building software. While it's a casual project, I still adhere to solid principles and best practices, especially **Clean Architecture**.

This project is built using React Native Expo!

## 🏗 Project Philosophy

- **Relaxed Development** – No rush, just building something fun and meaningful.
- **Showcasing My Approach** – This project serves as an example of how I structure and develop software.
- **Clean Architecture** – A well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns.

## ✅ To-Do List

- [ ] UI testing for **Suggestion** and **Detail** pages
- [ ] Fix broken unit tests
- [ ] Improve search algorithm for better ingredient matching
- [ ] Optimize performance for large ingredient lists
- [ ] Add favorite recipes feature
- [ ] Enhance UI/UX for a smoother user experience

## 📋 Note

I don't use redux in this project, but thanks to clean architecture, it can be installed and used flawlessly by implementing new data sources for it.

Made with ❤️ and clean code.
